# iPhone Zambia — Business Plan

## Executive Summary

iPhone Zambia is an e-commerce business selling genuine Apple iPhones to customers in Zambia through an online storefront with mobile money payments via PawaPay. The business targets the growing smartphone market in Zambia, offering a trusted, convenient way to purchase the latest iPhones without needing a credit card or bank account.

## Problem

- Buying iPhones in Zambia is difficult — limited authorized retailers, high markups, and trust issues with informal sellers
- Most Zambians don't have credit cards but do have mobile money wallets (MTN, Airtel, Zamtel)
- No dedicated, trustworthy online iPhone store exists for the Zambian market

## Solution

A simple, mobile-friendly online shop where customers can:
1. Browse available iPhone models with clear pricing in ZMW (Zambian Kwacha)
2. Purchase with one click using mobile money (PawaPay integration)
3. Receive their device via delivery
